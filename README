There was a plan to turn the Firefox add-on install dialog into a doorhanger dialog:

This was abandoned in favor of an approach using tabs:

Rather than let the work for the former approach go to waste, we are releasing it as an add-on.

USAGE:

- It only works for remote installs. For local installs, the current dialog shows
- Clicking anywhere outside the doorhanger dismisses it and cancels the install.
- Switching to a new tab or window when the doorhanger is open cancels the install.
